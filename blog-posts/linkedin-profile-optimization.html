                            LinkedIn has evolved from a simple networking tool to the primary platform for professional discovery and 
                            career advancement. With over 900 million users worldwide, standing out requires strategic optimization of 
                            every profile element. Your LinkedIn profile is your digital business card, portfolio, and networking hub 
                            all rolled into one—and getting it right can be the difference between your dream job finding you or passing you by.

                        <h2>Crafting a Compelling Headline</h2>
                        <p>
                            Your headline is the first thing people see when they find your profile, yet most professionals waste this 
                            prime real estate with generic job titles. Your headline should be a value proposition that immediately 
                            communicates what makes you unique and valuable.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Headline Best Practices:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Include Relevant Keywords:</strong> Use terms recruiters search for in your industry</li>
                            <li><strong>Highlight Your Value:</strong> Focus on what you accomplish, not just what you do</li>
                            <li><strong>Use Numbers When Possible:</strong> Quantify your impact with specific metrics</li>
                            <li><strong>Stay Under 220 Characters:</strong> Make every character count for maximum impact</li>
                            <li><strong>Make It Scannable:</strong> Use vertical bars (|) or bullet points to separate key elements</li>
                        </ul>

                        <div class="example-box">
                            <h4>Headline Examples:</h4>
                            <p><strong>Before:</strong> "Software Engineer at TechCorp"</p>
                            <p><strong>After:</strong> "Senior Software Engineer | Increased App Performance 40% | Python, React, AWS | Building Scalable Solutions"</p>

                        <h2>Professional Photo Strategy</h2>
                        <p>
                            Profiles with professional photos receive 21 times more profile views and 36 times more messages. Your photo 
                            is often the first impression you make, so it needs to reflect professionalism while showing your personality.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Photo Requirements:</h3>

                            <li><strong>Professional but Approachable:</strong> Dress slightly more formal than your typical work attire</li>
                            <li><strong>Appropriate Background:</strong> Simple, non-distracting background that complements your industry</li>
                            <li><strong>Recent and Accurate:</strong> Update regularly to reflect your current appearance</li>
                            <li><strong>Consistent Branding:</strong> Align with your personal brand and industry expectations</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Writing a Powerful Summary</h2>
                        <p>
                            Your summary is your elevator pitch in written form. You have 2,000 characters to tell your professional 
                            story, demonstrate your value, and persuade readers to connect with you or explore opportunities.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Summary Structure:</h3>

                            <li><strong>Hook (1-2 sentences):</strong> Start with an attention-grabbing statement about your expertise</li>
                            <li><strong>Value Proposition:</strong> Explain what you do and the problems you solve</li>
                            <li><strong>Proof Points:</strong> Include specific achievements with metrics and results</li>
                            <li><strong>Personality:</strong> Show who you are beyond your resume with passion and interests</li>
                            <li><strong>Call to Action:</strong> Invite connections, opportunities, or conversations</li>
                        </ul>

                            "Your LinkedIn summary should read like a conversation, not a resume. Tell your story in a way that

                        <h2>Optimizing Your Experience Section</h2>
                        <p>
                            Don't just list job duties—tell the story of your impact and growth. Each role should demonstrate progression, 
                            achievement, and value creation using specific examples and quantifiable results.
                        </p>

                            <li><strong>Use Action Verbs:</strong> Start bullet points with strong verbs that show impact</li>
                            <li><strong>Include Keywords:</strong> Naturally incorporate relevant industry terms for searchability</li>
                            <li><strong>Focus on Achievements:</strong> Emphasize results and outcomes rather than responsibilities</li>

                        <h2>Skills and Endorsements Strategy</h2>
                        <p>
                            LinkedIn allows up to 50 skills on your profile, but strategic curation is more important than quantity. 
                            Your skills section should reflect your expertise while incorporating relevant keywords for discoverability.
                        </p>
